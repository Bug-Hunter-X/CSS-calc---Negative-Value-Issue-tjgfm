The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if you use it with units such as `px` and `%`, and the calculation produces a negative value, it can lead to unexpected behavior or rendering issues.  For example, if you try to set `width: calc(100% - 200px)` and the parent element is smaller than 200px, the calculated width will be negative, which can be ignored or interpreted differently by browsers.
