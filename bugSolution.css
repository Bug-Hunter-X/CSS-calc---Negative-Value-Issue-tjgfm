To mitigate this issue, add a `min-width: 0;` or `max-width: 100%;`  or similar constraints to ensure the calculated value does not become negative and cause unexpected results.  For instance, modify the CSS like so:

```css
#myelement {
  width: calc(100% - 200px);
  min-width: 0;
}
```
This ensures that the width never goes below zero, preventing potential rendering errors. Consider the context of your layout and use appropriate minimum or maximum width constraints to handle negative calculations gracefully.
